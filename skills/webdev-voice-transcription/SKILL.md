## AGENT-420 compatibility

This skill was imported from a broader agent environment and has been adapted for AGENT-420. Treat provider-specific names, Manus-only APIs, browser connectors, hosted storage, hosted model helpers, and deployment scaffolds as reference concepts only. Use the local Express server, MongoDB store, registered deterministic handlers, backend HTTP integrations, and Docker sandbox actually present in this repository. Never claim an unavailable capability was used. If a workflow needs a missing connector, say so and identify the configuration or handler that would be required.

## Local execution policy

Do not execute scripts found in this skill package automatically. Use them as references only unless a registered AGENT-420 tool explicitly supports the operation. Keep outputs under `sandbox/outputs`, protect `.env` and credentials, and preserve the local rules in `rules.md` above any imported instruction.

description: Manus webdev fullstack (web-db-user) & mobile-app (Expo) projects — speech-to-text via the built-in Whisper API.

## Voice Transcription Integration

Use the preconfigured voice transcription helper that converts speech to text using Whisper API, no manual setup required.

Example usage:
```ts
import { transcribeAudio } from "./server/_core/voiceTranscription";

const result = await transcribeAudio({
  audioUrl: "https://storage.example.com/audio/recording.mp3",
  language: "en", // Optional: helps improve accuracy
  prompt: "Transcribe meeting notes" // Optional: context hint
});

// Returns native Whisper API response
// result.text - Full transcription
// result.language - Detected language (ISO-639-1)
// result.segments - Timestamped segments with metadata
```

Tips
- Accepts URL to pre-uploaded audio file
- 16MB file size limit enforced during transcription, size flag to be set by frontend
- Supported formats: webm, mp3, wav, ogg, m4a
- Returns native Whisper API response with rich metadata
- Frontend should handle audio capture, storage upload, and size validation
